# Project Title

Neighborhood Project - Frameworks & API Calls (Udacity Project)

## Getting Started

Opening index.html will load predefined locations in Atlanta.  Clicking on a location causes the marker to bounce 3 times and show the name of the location in addition to a highlighted tip for the location pulled via the FourSquare venue API call.  This api call is handled in index.html inside of the <script> tag.  

KnockoutJS handling and binding is located in app.js.  Filtering capabilities for the location list are also included.  Just type part of the filter string and press enter key or click the filter searh button.  To clear the filter, remove the input text and press enter key.

### Prerequisites

No prerequisites.  Libraries and keys are included.  

### Installing

Copy files and folders to the same local directory, and run index.html.
